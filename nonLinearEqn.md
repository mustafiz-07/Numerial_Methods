This part provides multiple methods for finding the roots of a polynomial function.It uses Bisection, False Position, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods to determine the roots based on user-provided polynomial coefficients and other parameters.
Features:
1.Polynomial Input: Accepts the degree and coefficients of a polynomial.
2.Root Finding Methods:
    a)Bisection Method
    b)False Position Method
    c)Newton-Raphson Method
    d)Secant Method
3.Precision and Tolerable Error: User-defined precision and tolerable error for root accuracy.
4.Multiple Roots: Allows repeated root-finding attempts on the same polynomial.
