# function58.hpp Description

This file contains some numerical methods for solving linear equation system and differential equation.It includes:

- Gaussian Elimination

- Gauss-Jordan Elimination

- Matrix Invertion using Gauss-Jordan Elimination

- Runge-Kutta method 
## Features
*Gaussian Elimination:*  Solves a system of linear equations using forword Elimination and back substitution

*Proccess:*

       Step 1:Read the number of variable
       Step 2:Read the coeffecients(A) and Constants(B)
       Step 3:Transform the Matrixs to Upper Trainagular Matrix by Row Operations
       Step 4:Get Solution by back substitution
       Step 5:Show the result
